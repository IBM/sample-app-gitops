# Changed

- b62e1f0 Stop using LoadBalancer type as default to prevent exposing Humio without TLS unless explicitly configured.

_Note: before updating, you must delete the services `humio-humio-core-http` and `humio-humio-core-es` as the default
type has changed from `LoadBalancer` to type `ClusterIP`. If you have defined `service.type` then you don't need to
change anything._
